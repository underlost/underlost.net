### About this site

Underlost.net used to be my portfolio website. Now, it functions as a playground for me to try new frameworks and technologies. You can still see some of my <InnerLink text={`personal projects`} to={`/portfolio`} /> I'm working on though. I'm still weighing options on where to publish case studies and talk about previous professional works.

The current site is built using ReactJS (specifically GatsbyJS). The logo animation is using GSAP, the UI is based on a heavily moddified version of Bootstrap. The background image is something I rendered in Unity game engine. The primary typeface for the site is [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans).

Staging and testing is done on Heroku, while the live site is mostly on [netlify.com](https://netlify.com). 

The source code can be viewed on my [Github](https://github.com/underlost/underlost.net/).
