The International Living Future Institute (ILFI) is a nonprofit organization that aims to build an ecologically-minded, restorative world for all people. Fighting for social and environmental justice, ILFI looks to battle climate change and rid urban environments of dependency of fossil fuels.

Partnering with Seattle based design firm, Wildern, we built a custom WordPress theme from the ground up that allowed for incredible customization and page building techniques that would allow ILFI to create beautiful pages and show case various case studies for years to come.
