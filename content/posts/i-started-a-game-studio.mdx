### Today I’m thrilled to announce Jaded Gamer, a new mobile app development studio.

Some of you may remember  [Jaded Gamer](http://jadedgamer.com/)  as being a news aggregator I built a while ago. It was a small web app I bootstrapped from the ground up, that among other things featured real time news aggregation allowing you to see a birds eye view of several popular gaming news websites all in one place. For some time it was even a great source of passive income. Unfortunately, after changes to hosting structures, the upkeep became too expensive. It was however a good learning experience as to what it takes to build a modern day web app.

### What's Next

The original web app will still live on as [Video Game News](https://news.jadedgamer.com), a more scaled down version of what it was. New features will still slowly be added over time, but it will no longer be the main focus of Jaded.

Instead, my main focus now about creating my first mobile game, **Project Magnolia**. I don’t have a lot of details to share right now, but a sneak peak will be coming in the next few months!
