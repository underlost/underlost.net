Gamehackers.net originally started out as a early 2000's website for the members of Team Limited Edition to hang out, and post various hacks, exploits and tutorials for various Battle net games like Diablo and Starcraft.

After some time in limbo, I acquired the domain. I plain on paying homage to the people that helped make it a great resource for gaming hacking, while exploring a safe, legal place to discus and share various tools and exploits for games for educational purposes.

As I build Build GameHackers, I've started an interim site to work with local game developers and hackers to create something cool and decide on the features to build out first. Learn more at [SeattleIndieDev](https//seattleindie.dev).
