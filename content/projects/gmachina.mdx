gMachina is a RESTFUL, API based game engine service. The idea is to provide a **centralized** database to build and interact with. Imagine if you could send commands in the form of GET or POST requests to a Tamagotchi, with a dash of Neopets or Gaia thrown in, and you would get something like gMachina.

gMachina is a small side project I'm working on in my freetime. It currently does not have a release date, however documentation is expected to go online in Summer 2020.
