### Hey there!

I am Tyler, but most probably know me better simply as Underlost. I'm a somewhat unusual hybrid of designer and developer, with an interest of [photography](http://tyler.camera/) mixed in on the side. In a past life I had a background in information computer security, and built a successful web hosting business. I've since returned to my true passion of web development. I love exploring and experimenting with new web trends and technology. If you use the Internet, you've probably seen some of my work.

### Current Projects

I just finished building [Jaded Gamer](http://jadedgamer.com/), an experiment in bootstrapping a modern day startup. You should read more about that [here](https://medium.com/jaded-gamer/building-jaded-gamer-e08c6532b56d). Right now I'm mostly focusing on relaunching my other site, [A Life Well Played](http://alifewellplayed/), and building the blog engine, [Replica](http://tyler.codes/Replica/), which powers it.

### Elsewhere

I blog about life and random things regularly on [Medium](http://medium.com/@underlost). I occasionally tweet at [@underlost](http://twitter.com/underlost/), and publish code on [Github](https://github.com/underlost/).
