---

For a while, I've been thinking about having some sort of self-hosted mini steam profile so I could play around with the Steam Web API. Over the weekend I decided it was time to take a break from some other stuff and give it a go. The result is [Vapor](http://vapor.underlost.net/id/underlost/tf2), a Django/Python web app.

The original plan was just to have it for my profile only, but after talking to a couple people, I've decided I'll be moving it to its own website, with a mobile version coming eventually.

You can give it a try right now with your own profile, simply by going to: <code>http:://vapor.underlost.net/tf2/SteamID</code>.

### To do:
* <strike>Portal 2 Backpacks</strike>
* <strike>Dota2 Backpacks</strike>
* Sort functionality
* TF2 loadouts
* Mobile version
