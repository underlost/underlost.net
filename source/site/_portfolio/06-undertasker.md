UnderTasker helps you bootstrap your website/app using a Gulp & Node.JS stack that's also highly configurable. Out of the box, UnderTasker compiles assets like coffeescript and SASS, compresses Javascript with UglifyJS, and autoprefixes CSS. It can also compress images using Imagemin. It can even be used to quickly publish static HTML sites to services like Github Pages.

It does rely on jekyll for building and validating HTML, however it can be swapped with a different templating engine, like Jade.
