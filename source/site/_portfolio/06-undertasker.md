UnderTasker helps you bootstrap your website/app using a Grunt & Node.JS stack that's also highly configurable. Out of the box, UnderTasker compiles assets like coffeescript and LESS, compresses Javascript with UglifyJS, and autoprefixes CSS. It can also compress images with grunt-contrib-imagemin.

It does rely on jekyll for building and validating HTML, however it can be swapped with a templating engine, like Jade. And when everything's ready to go, you can easily publish static websites to github Pages with a single command.
