Replica is a content management system written in Python/django. It was originally developed for clients that found existing systems too complicated. It features a simple Markdown editor and a live preview mode. I've continued to develop it into a stand alone django application, and even adopted it for my personal blog at [A Life Well Played](http://alifewellplayed.com/).
