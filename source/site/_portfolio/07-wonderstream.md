Wonderstream, originally branded as Frontrow.Live, is a live streaming startup service. As Sembia, partnered with the amazing design firm [Wildern](http://hellowildern.com) to build a beautifully designed and functional live streaming platform.

We helped their team build their entire system from scratch, utilizing the Wowza cloud platform. Using a Django and Python stack, we implemented scheduling, and tools for frontend users to create and manage their streams.

Other features built include geofencing, whitelisting users for livestreams, and a chat live system powered with Twitter. Additionally, I helped build custom payment processing forms powered by stripe that dynamically calculates tax rates based on the user's location.
