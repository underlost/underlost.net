The International Living Future Institute was so happy with the work we've done for the custom theme with their main site, they asked for an additional child theme for for their Conference based sites, like the Living Future Unconference. The new child theme added support for vide componenets, scheduling tools including the ability to import and populate the site with data from their scheduling service [Sched](https://sched.com).
