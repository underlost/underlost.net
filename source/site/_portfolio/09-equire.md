I helped bring [Wildern's](http://hellowildern.com) designs to life in the form of static HTML templates, to be able to be handed of to the client's developer team to implement in their custom backend system.

The static templates take advantage of a custom gulp build system and Jekyll, as well as other modern web technologies like SCSS. The eQuire Templates feature amazing css animations, background video, and Bootstrap v4.
