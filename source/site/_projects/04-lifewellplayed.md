A Life Well played is a blog in which I post social commentary on gender and sexuality in video games and pop culture. The site is powered by my custom Content Management system (CMS), Replica, written in Python/Django.


#### About Replica
Replica was originally developed for clients that found existing systems too complicated. It features a simple Markdown editor and a live preview mode. I've continued to develop it and expand on it's features. Replica is currently deeply integrated into [ALWP](https://alifewellplayed.com/) as I build out new features and improve on the current codebase. I plan on eventually separating it into its own package after it's in a more stable form.
