Gamehackers.net originally started out as a early 2000's website for the members of Team Limited Edition to hang out, and post various hacks, exploits and tutorials for various Battle net games like Diablo and Starcraft.

After some time in limo, I've finally acquired the domain. I plain on paying homage to the people that helped make it a great resource, while exploring a safe, legal place to discus and share various tools and exploits for games for educational purposes.
