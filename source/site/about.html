              <p class="lead">I’m a hybrid writer, UX designer and developer, with an interest in <a href="https://tyler.camera/" target="_blank">photography</a> and <a href="https://alifewellplayed.com/" target="_blank">videogames</a> mixed in on the side. I'm basically the bard of the group.</p>

            <div data-animate="fadeLeft" class="layout-single-column">
              <p>In a past life, I had a background in information computer security and built a successful web hosting business. Since then, I've worked as a UX designer and consultant for a few video games and virtual reality experiences.</p>
              <p>I'm influenced by point and click adventure games, bad 90's movies, Star Wars, Cardcaptor Sakura, Sailor Moon, Ghost in the Shell, Dungeons & Dragons, technomancy, and cyberpunk architecture.</p>
              <p>If you've ever <em>liked</em> something on the internet, interacted with an <em>eye</em> catching VR experience, played a terrific MMO, or visited the <em>WineCountry</em>, you’ve probably seen some of my work. <em>I'm sorry about that</em>.</p>
              <p>My work has been featured on CNN, ABC (Australia), and various local news outlets in the Seattle area.</p>
              <h5 class="headline h4 text-lowercase mt-md-4 text-green">Currently...</h5>
              <p>I've been creating things digitally for roughly two decades, since I was 10 years old. Currently, I'm working as a developer at <a href="https://www.hellowildern.com/">Wildern</a> in Seattle. For work enquires, please see my availability!</p>
