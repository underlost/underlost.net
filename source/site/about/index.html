                    <p>I am Tyler, but most probably know me better simply as Underlost.
                        I’m a somewhat unusual hybrid of designer and developer, with an interest of <a href="http://tyler.camera/">photography</a> and <a href="http://alifewellplayed.com/">video games</a> mixed in on the side.</p>

                    <p>In a past life, I had a background in information computer security and built a successful web hosting business.
                        I’ve since returned to my true passion of web development, where I love exploring and experimenting with new web trends and technology.</p>

                    <p>If you use the Internet, you’ve probably seen some of my work.</p>
