      <p class="lead">For 2018, I'll be providing assistance for small organizations and other indie developers that may not be able to afford my normal rates.</p>
      <p>Each month I'll be allocating roughly 10-15 hours of my time to assist with consulting and development. For areas of expertise and ways I may be of service, please see the <a href="/work/">Availability section</a>.</p>

    <h4 class="heading"><span>Restrictions & Terms</span></h4>
    <p>I'll be offering my services at no cost to small organizations, indie developers, minorities, and any other cool and fun projects that I find interesting. Everything is on a case-by-case basis, and I reserve the right to decline my services for any reason.</p>
