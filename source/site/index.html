    <p>I am Tyler, but most probably know me better simply as <a class="highlight" href="/underlost/">underlost</a>.
      I’m a somewhat unusual hybrid of designer and developer, with an interest in <a href="http://tyler.camera/">photography</a> and <a href="http://alifewellplayed.com/">video games</a> mixed in on the side.</p>

    <p>I am currently working as a web developer at <a href="https://www.hellowildern.com/">Wildern</a>.</p>

  <div data-animate="fadeLeft" class="layout-single-column">
    <p>In a past life, I had a background in information computer security and built a successful web hosting business. Since then, I've worked as a UI designer for a few video games and virtual reality experiences.</p>
    <p>If you've ever liked something on the internet, interacted with an <em>eye</em> catching VR experience, or visited the <em>Wine Country</em>, you’ve probably seen some of my work. <em>I'm sorry</em>.</p>
