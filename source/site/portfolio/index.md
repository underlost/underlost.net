Below are some projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the years. They demonstrate some of my abilities, ranging from coding to design. Some of the listed projects are also open source and can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/underlost/) page. For photography, make sure to check out my [blog](http://tyler.camera/), as well as my [Flickr](http://tyler.camera/) page.
