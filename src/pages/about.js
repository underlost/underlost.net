          In a past life, I had a background in information computer security and built a successful web hosting business. Since then, I&apos;ve worked as a UX designer and consultant for
          a few video games and virtual reality experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m influenced by point and click adventure games, trashy 90&apos;s movies, Star Wars, Cardcaptor Sakura, Sailor Moon, Ghost in the Shell, Dungeons & Dragons, technomancy,
          and cyberpunk architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve been creating things digitally for roughly two decades. If you&apos;ve ever <em>liked</em> something on the internet, interacted with an <em>eye</em> catching VR
          experience, played a terrific MMO, or visited the
          {` `}
          <em>Wine Country</em>, youâ€™ve probably seen some of my work.{` `}
          <em>I&apos;m sorry about that</em>.
        </p>
        <p>My work has also been featured on CNN, ABC (Australia), and various local news outlets in Seattle, Washington.</p>

          Currently, I&apos;m working as a developer at <a href="https://www.hellowildern.com/">Wildern</a> in Seattle. For any web development or design project enqueries, please send me
